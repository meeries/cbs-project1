This project was done with Python and Django, using the [OWASP 2021](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) list for flaws.

## Starting the app

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the directory that has file ```manage.py``` and run command ```python3 manage.py runserver```
3. Execute the migrations by running commands ```python3 manage.py makemigrations```
   and ```python3 manage.py migrate```
4. Open the address shown in the terminal, and log in with username: ```username``` and password: ```password```

## Flaws and their fixes:

## Flaw 1: CSRF (Cross-site request forgery)

### Description
CSRF is a security vulnerability, where an attacker tricks a user's browser into making illegitimate requests to a website or web application, where the user is authenticated. Because the server trusts the authenticated user's browser, it believes the requests to be legitimate, even when they are in fact unauthorized. The attacker can, for example, change users' data, without the user's knowledge.

### Fix
CSRF attacks can be prevented by introducing a CSRF token, that is generated by the server and difficult (if not impossible) to guess. When a user submits a form or makes a request, the server ensures that the token matches the one stored for the user. Nowadays, most frameworks, including Django, provide defences for CSRF attacks. So, to introduce this flaw, I added ```@csrf_exempt``` to bypass Django's defence. This flaw can be fixed by removing this, and thus enabling Django's CSRF protection.
